# My Dearest Simran,

I don't know where to begin, but I know that every word I write here comes straight from my heart.

## The Day Everything Changed

Do you remember that first call at *4 AM*? I was half asleep, and then I heard your voice. You told me to keep my WiFi on when I sleep. Such a small thing, but it meant everything. It meant you wanted to reach me, anytime, anywhere.

> "Some people come into your life and you just know — you'll never be the same."

That's what you did to me.

## What You Mean to Me

I've tried to put it into words so many times, but how do you describe something so **infinite**? Here's what I know for sure:

- Your laugh is my favorite sound in the world
- Your eyes hold entire galaxies
- When you're in my arms, I forget that time exists
- Every moment with you feels like a gift I don't deserve

## A Promise

I promise to:

1. Always answer your calls, no matter the time
2. Hold you like you're the most precious thing in this world — because you are
3. Love you more with each passing day
4. Be your home, your safe place, your everything

*Simran*, you are not just someone I love. You are the reason I understand what love truly means.

**Forever and always yours.**
