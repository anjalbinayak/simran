# Simran,

Today was different. Today was *ours*.

We both called in at work. We chose each other over everything else. And for one whole day, the world didn't exist — only you and me.

## Every Moment

You walked through my door, and suddenly my house felt like home. Real home. The kind that has nothing to do with walls and everything to do with who's inside them.

> "Home is not a place. It's a person. And you, Simran, are my home."

We laughed. We talked about nothing and everything. We held each other like we were afraid to let go.

## The Little Things You Left Behind

When you left, I found your dress. Your hair clip. Little pieces of you scattered around my room like tiny treasures. I didn't put them away. I couldn't. They remind me that you were here. That this was real.

**Your dress** — still carries your scent

**Your hair clip** — the one you use to keep your hair away from your face when you're being serious

These aren't just things anymore. They're pieces of *us*.

## What I Realized That Night

Lying in bed after you left, I realized something profound:

1. I don't just want moments with you
2. I want *every* moment with you
3. I want lazy mornings and late nights
4. I want your things scattered in my space
5. I want to build a life where days like today aren't rare — they're normal

*Come back soon.* My room feels empty without you, and my heart even more so.

**Counting the hours until I see you again.**
